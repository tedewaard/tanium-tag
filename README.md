## Tanium Tagging
This is an example command line tool used to apply Tanium custom tags to machines. This is useful if you need to apply a tag directly on the machine without going through Tanium. Or during initial setup of a PC to place a tag quickly. It also allows other partys like Service Desk to apply custom tags without needing to go into Tanium.


### Tagging
The tool is configured to prompt first for any core tags that should be on every single machine. Then you have the option of selecting if you want to apply Business Unit tags or Application tags. The idea is really to provide an example structure as a template. You can update the logic as you see fit and you can update the tags within the tags.go file.
